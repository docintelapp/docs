# Managing groups

With DocIntel, you can easily control who has access to which documents by
creating groups for users. This way, you can release documents to a group of
users all at once, instead of having to manage permissions individually. With
ad-hoc groups, you can easily enforce TLP markings. For example, if you only
want the attendees of a specific conference to see TLP:Red slides, you can
create a group for them.

The administrative functions for groups, including modifying membership and
permissions, require special permission. If you don't see the buttons or links
described in the documentation, please check that your user level has the
correct permissions for those actions.
