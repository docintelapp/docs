# Roles

It is often convenient to group users together to ease management of
permissions. Permissions can be granted to, or revoked from, a group of users as
a whole and not individually. In DocIntel, this is done by creating a role that
represents the group of users, and then granting membership in the role to
individual users.

To create, update, delete roles, as well as to add or remove members, you need
the corresponding specific permissions. If you do not see the buttons and links
described in the documentation, check first that you have the right to perform
these actions.
