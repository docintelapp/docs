# Dependencies

DocIntel depends on the following software:

* PostgreSQL, 
* Apache Solr, 
* RabbitMQ,
* and Vertex Synapse.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open-source
object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active
development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation in
the software development community.

[Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) is an impressive open-source search
engine built on the Lucene Java search library. It provides blazing-fast search
and indexing, powerful features for faceted navigation, and extensive
configurability. Apache Solr is highly scalable, providing fault-tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features
of many of the world's largest websites.

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is a message broker that enables
applications to communicate with one another. It supports a wide range of
messaging patterns, including publish/subscribe, fan-out/fan-in, and
request/reply. RabbitMQ also has a robust set of features that make it an ideal
platform for building mission-critical applications.

[Synapse](https://vertex.link/) is a platform that helps analysts answer
difficult questions by fusing data from various sources. Within the tool,
knowledge is organized as a hypergraph, which allows cyber threat intelligence
analysts to perform and record precise analyses. The Synapse data model has
been refined over 8 years through the lessons learned during intelligence
analysis and production.
