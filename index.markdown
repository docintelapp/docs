# DocIntel Documentation

This website provides the official documentation for DocIntel written by
developers, users, and volunteers. It explains all current software
functionality that DocIntel supports.

To make the large amount of information about DocIntel manageable, we have
organized this site into several parts. Each part is aimed at a different group
of users or those in different stages with their DocIntel experience.

* The [preface](/docs/preface/) provides a beginner's guide for those that are
  new to DocIntel. It explains what is DocIntel, why it might be relevant for
  your organization, and how to get started.

* The Administration Guide go over how to install and administrate the server.
  If you are running a DocIntel instance for yourself or others, it is
  imperative that you read this section.

* The User Guide explains how to use the DocIntel software. All users of
  DocIntel should read it.

Good documentation takes more time to write than an article or blog post. There
will be sections of the documentation that are not yet completed, but please
open issues on our GitHub so we can know what needs to be worked on first.
